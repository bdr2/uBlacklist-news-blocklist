# uBlacklist News Blocklist
A news blocklist/filter list for the [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) browser extension.

## What is uBlacklist?
uBlacklist is a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome (and an app for macOS and iOS for Safari) that blocks specific sites from appearing in search results by Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and many other search engine websites.

## What is uBlacklist News Blocklist?
This particular blocklist is for filtering out search results in the "News" sections of search engine sites. It is mostly for filtering out international (primarily Indian) news sources in Google News, DuckDuckGo News, and Bing News.

In addition, this blocklist blocks the msn.com (Microsoft Start) takeover of articles on DuckDuckGO/Bing News search. Their news search results can be especially annoying when so many of the links are to the "msn.com version" of an article, where it will prompt you with a button to "Continue reading on the app" (if on a phone/mobile).

(Note that it doesn't show or link to the article from the original website... It just blocks any news search result that is to msn.com.)
